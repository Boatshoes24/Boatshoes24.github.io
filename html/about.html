<h1>About Us</h1>
<div class="container">
  <p><strong><span class="colorWrap">Stay Mad</span></strong> is a horde guild located on US Area 52 that is focused on mythic progression while maintaining a bit more of a casual schedule. Success and longevity in this guild rely not only on skill, but on how well you interact with others in the group. Many of us have been playing together for several years, which helps make the guild atmosphere more lighthearted and fun while not detracting from our main goal of progressing at a pace reasonable to our lighter schedule.</p> 
  <br>
  <br>
  <h4>Our Expectations</h4>
  <p>Most of our expectations are similar to any others you'll be accustomed to if you have raided
  with any mid-tier to high-end group. We do not require any alts, but we are certainly not against
  players keeping up with an additional character that may benefit the group for boss-specific mechanics. You should plan to get an idea of boss mechanics beforehand, come prepared with consumables, and most importantly you should try to interact with other guild members through things like alt runs, mythic plus, or even playing other games. We do not require that you play 40 hours per week. Our members span a large variety of play time, from those that seem to always be on to those you may not see much more than their weekly requirements. We just ask that you are keeping up reasonably with the group and if there's any specific goal requirements you'll be informed in plenty of time to accomplish them.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h4>What You Can Expect From Us</h4>
  <p>Having a tight-knit group has long been an appeal of the group. Most people who join end up staying for a long stretch of time. Some new recruits may find this off-putting at first, but we are very open to making new friends and try to avoid cliques and bias as much as possible. Our officers are also generally very approachable and available outside of raid times. At the end of the day we are mostly a group of adults with a similar passion that we want to make as enjoyable as possible.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
